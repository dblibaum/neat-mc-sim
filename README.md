# neat-mc-sim
Atomic simulation using a markov chain model, where the probabilities of state transitions are determined by a NEAT neural network.

Note that this script attempts to train the neural network.

Requires the MultiNEAT package (http://multineat.com) as well as PyCUDA (http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda/).
